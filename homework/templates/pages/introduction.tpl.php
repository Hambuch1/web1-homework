
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<br>
<p>The Cegléd Railway Sports Association was founded in 1935 and currently operates 5 divisions with nearly 800 athletes. It is the largest and most successful sports association in the city of Cegléd.</p>

<p>Our facility was built in 1905 and operated as a synagogue until 1969, when it was purchased by our association for athletes and has been operating as a sports hall ever since.</p>



<p>More and more of the non-governmental organizations operating in the city of Cegléd use our facility for leisure sports, and due to the limited supply of gyms in our city for two years, two primary schools in the city of Cegléd also hold physical education classes here.</p>

<p>The activities of our association cover competitive sports, school physical education and leisure sports within departments.</p>

<p>80% of the members are students, which also means that we treat youth education as a priority in the association. We can boast of numerous podium finishes in Hungarian championships and various competitions and cups, most of which are due to our athletes under the age of 18.</p>

<p>Our association has several NB I, NB II, NB III and Class I athletes. Currently, 31 of our athletes are national team members.</p>

<p>The competitors of our association achieve excellent domestic and international successes, results that the City of Cegléd can rightly be proud of.</p>

<p>Based on its domestic and international results, Table Tennis, Wrestling, Judo, Fitness, Water Polo and Football stand out among our divisions.</p>

<p>In order to maintain the standard achieved by the departments and to obtain additional national and international results - thus increasing the recognition of our city - the association cannot do without the financial support of the sponsors.</p>

<p>Numerous national and foreign competitions provide an excellent opportunity for material services of an advertising nature based on mutual interests.</p>
